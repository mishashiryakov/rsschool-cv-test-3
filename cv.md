## 3. Summary  
   
I would like to become a part of community that creates practically everything in our modern world.  
Learning new information every day, communication with smart people and creating useful projects  
 is my goal.

## 4. Skills  
   
   I am learning Java Script right now. Also I passed some courses on HTML&CSS.

## 5. Code examples   
   
## Is a number prime?
   
    function isPrime(num) {  
      if (num <= 1) return false;

      for(let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {  
        if (num % i == 0) return false;  
      }  
      return true;
    }

## Find The Duplicated Number in a Consecutive Unsorted List

    function findDup( arr ){  
      arr.sort(function compareNumbers(a, b) {  
        return a - b;  
      });

      for(let i = 0 ; ; i++) {  
        if (i == arr[i]) return i;  
      }
    }

## Anagram Detection

    var isAnagram = function(test, original) {  

      test = test.toLowerCase().split('').sort().join();  
      original = original.toLowerCase().split('').sort().join();  

      return (test == original) ? true : false;  
    };  

## 6. Experience  
   
    I've started my codewars profile where I solve different JS tasks.

## 7. Education  
   
I graduated from Gymnasium №1 with Physics and Mathematics faculty in Vitebsk. Then I graduated  
from Belarusian National Technical University with a degree in economics, logistics and engineering.

## 8. English
   
I have been studying English at school and university for about 15 years. I've always loved to speak it  
and to understand more their culture. I've never talked to a native speaker before I had a chance to visit  
the USA via work&travel programm for studens. Three month of summer 2017 I spent in the US and it  
was the best practice of English for me, I suppose. I worked as a waiter and everyday I communicated  
with native speakers who visited the restaurant I worked at. The whole team was also American.  
So English language takes a big part in my life experience.
